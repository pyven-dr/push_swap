# Push_swap

## This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

## How to use

### Sort a stack

Clone 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyven-dr/push_swap.git
```

Compile
```bash
make
```

Run it
```bash
./push_swap <numbers>
./push_swap 5 4 8 6 2 1 -5 654645
```

Numbers can be positive or negative integers. There must not be any duplicates numbers.
The program will output the list of instruction needed to sort the stack.

### Use the checker

Compile
```bash
make bonus
```

The checker can be used to check if a list of instruction sort the stack.

The checker can be used that way
```bash
ARG="5 4 3 8 7 2 1"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
You can also use the checker only and manually enter the instructions to see if they sort the stack
```bash
./checker <numbers>
```

## Instruction list

| Instruction | Description                                                                                                |
| :--------   | :-------                                                                                                   |
| `sa`        | (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| `sb`        | (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. |
| `ss`        | `sa` and `sb` at the same time.                                                                            |
| `pa`        | (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.     |
| `pb`        | (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.     |
| `ra`        | (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.                 |
| `rb`        | (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.                 |
| `rr`        | `ra` and `rb` at the same time.                                                                            |
| `rra`       | (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.       |
| `rrb`       | (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.       |
| `rrr`       | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.                                                                          |
